JS Arithmetic
Brief:

In this challenge you are to use your knowledge of variables and basic arithmetic opertors to solve the following problems and equations.

 

Getting Started:

Create a new index.html file to work from and open it using live server.

Create a new JavaScript file called "js-arithmetics.js" or open up a <script> tag in your index.html file to write the code for your solution.

 

Challenge:

Use the formulae provided to calculate the areas of the circle, rectangle and triangle.

Create variables for each shape's measurements and use the constant variables in the code snippet to assist you. No hardcoded/ literal numbers are allowed to be used in your formulae.

 

Formulae:

Area of a Square = length x breadth 
Area of a Circle = πr² 
Area of a Triangle = half of base x height
 

Measurements:

Rectangle: length = 10, breadth = 17
Circle: radius = 25
Triangle: base = 20, height = 9
 

You are given the following code:
